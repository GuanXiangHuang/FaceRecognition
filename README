Face recognition and identification program that frames any detected faces and/or eyes and smiles.
Can differentiate and recognize different faces by identifying any detected faces with a label containing the persons name.

Need to have Python 3.7 and OpenCV installed on the machine.
Will also need to install Pillow via the Python shell.
You must have a functional webcam connected to your computer in order to test this program.

How to run:
1. In the "image" folder, add a folder and give the folder the name of a person that you would like to identify. This step can be repeated.
2. Upload multiple pictures of the persons face that you would like to identify in the created folder.
3. Open the terminal and go into the directory where the files are located.
4. Train your system with the newly added images by typing the command: python faces-train.py
5. Once it finishes to run, enter the following command to start the recognition program: python faces.py
6. Your webcam should turn on and a pop up of the video will appear

Uploading more pictures will improve the accuracy of this program since the system will have more material to train from.
